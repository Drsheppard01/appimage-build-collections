# Preambule
This project is intended to show how easy it is to create an AppImage

I have compiled what I believe to be the best build recipes that meet mainly the following criteria:
1. Project used runtime -- this is important to me because I am currently using @Chimera-Linux and I want to use AppImage as well.
2. Project doesn't use repackaging method

1. [nvtop](https://github.com/Samueru-sama/nvtop/blob/master/AppImage/make_appimage.sh) script was written by [Samueru-sama](https://github.com/Samueru-sama) and you can see how it's simple download deps -> build app -> download tool for building appimages -> build appimage
2. [cemu](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/blob/main/dist/linux/appimage.sh) written by [qurious-pixel](https://github.com/qurious-pixel)
