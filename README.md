# Preambule
This project is intended to show how easy it is to create an AppImage

I have compiled what I believe to be the best build recipes that meet mainly the following criteria:
1. Project used runtime -- this is important to me because I am currently using @Chimera-Linux and I want to use AppImage as well.
2. Project doesn't use repackaging method
